## Description
This task outlines work to improve map data in Turkey based on user feedback, and algorithmic estimations.  

First we'll contact the [talk-tr](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/talk-tr) mailing list, for feedback and/or suggestions.  Then we plan to correct the data where we can identify the missing roads don't exist, using sources listed below.

Improvements that are intended to enhance the data include the following:
* Adding missing roads
* Improving road attributes (names, lanes, restrictions, etc.)
* Correcting road connectivity issues
* Improving road classification consistency according to [OSM](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:highway) guidelines
* Correcting road alignment issues
* Attempt to resolve open notes
* Other one-off fixes

## Validation and Error Detection
Contributors will visually check for errors using [JOSM validation warnings](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM/Validator) prior to committing the changeset.

Additionally, contributors will review their work following the task guidelines including the [LearnOSM](http://learnosm.org/en/coordination/review/) and [OSM Wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_Tasking_Manager/Validating_data) validation standards.
