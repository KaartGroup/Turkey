# Turkey Mapping Projects
This repository tracks the various mapping projects throughout Turkey that are managed by [Kaart](https://github.com/KaartGroup/Turkey/blob/master/KAART.md "Kaart").

## Projects

### [Road Network Improvement Project](https://github.com/KaartGroup/Turkey/projects/1 "Project 1")
Using GIS analysis tools, we identified areas where there are believed to be missing roads. The purpose of this project is to digitize missing roads in Turkey and ensure a high quality road network.

We’ll start things off by getting in touch with the [talk-tr](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/talk-tr) mailing list to ask for suggestions and feedback. From here we will begin sifting through the data to identify areas where missing roads don’t exist.

#### Contributors
The project is open to OpenStreetMap contributors of any experience level.
